          <b>Note:</b> I don't take credit for this project! I followed a
          tutorial to make this at the end of my first year of university.
          <br />
          <br />
          Even though I didn't make this independently, it was a great learning
          experience nonetheless -- so it's here as a legacy project. It was
          also just really fun for me to make ðŸ˜Š. This is a platform adventure
          game that makes use of Unity's 2D Game Engine.

          If you want to give it a try, just press 'New Game' and use the arrows
          on the keyboard to move, and your space bar to jump. <br />
          (P.S: If you want to enter a new level, stand in front of the door and
          jump.)

            limitations!)
