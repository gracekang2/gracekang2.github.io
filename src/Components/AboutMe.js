            <br />
            <br/>
            I have interned at <span className={this.props.LandingColour}>Wish</span> and <span className={this.props.LandingColour}>Scotiabank</span> in the past, 
            and will be heading back to Wish as a SWE intern in Winter 2021 to continue sharpening my skills.
            While I am still exploring different fields of computer science, I am looking for opportunities that are educationally challenging, but also fulfilling. 
            I am starting to realize that I would like to spend my time creating meaningful technology, and I want my work to reflect that!

            Speaking in terms of my technical interests, I am mostly
            interested in backend development, though I have experience on the full-stack. For more
            information about my skillset or past technical experiences, you can
            head over to my skills summary or my coding experience section.
            <br /> 
            <br />
            Other than math and computer science, I love to take electives in english and psychology. If I didn't go into computer science, I probably 
            would have become an english major or a therapist. I also love to travel, read and spend time with my loved ones!
