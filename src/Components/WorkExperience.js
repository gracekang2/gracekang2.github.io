                I worked as a full-stack web developer on the GBM Web team, and
                created various web services for the trade floor. I used a
                Microsoft stack - ASP.NET, C#, SQL, and jQuery, and took full
                ownership over the development of multiple internal tools.<br/>
                It was a really beneficial learning experience for me, as my first co-op, as I 
                got the opportunity to work on the full stack and gain a solid understanding of both 
                backend and frontend development.
